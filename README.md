# neopfw

This code is intended to be used with a Neopixel Featherwing and Adafruit Feather (RP2040) to drive a Neopixel strip for use on a helmet when unicycling (or bicycling). Of course, it could be modified to make other interactive, wearable Neopixel things.

The Neopixel Featherwing can be purchased here: https://www.tindie.com/products/sonoclast/featherwing-for-wearable-battery-powered-neopixels/

Follow the instructions here to load it on an RP2040: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-pico
